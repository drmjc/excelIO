Description: This package allows import (XLS and XLSX) and export (XLS) of
    Microsoft Excel files. The excellent \code{gdata} package already provides
    \code{read.xls}, but occasionally the final column will containing trailing
    spaces, so my version fixes this. Users must install the perl module
