Description: This package allows import (XLS and XLSX) and export (XLS, XLSX)
    of Microsoft Excel files. The excellent \code{gdata} package already provides
    \code{read.xls}, but occasionally the final column will containing trailing
    spaces, so my version fixes this. This also writes single- and multi-sheet XLS
    and XLSX worksheets.
